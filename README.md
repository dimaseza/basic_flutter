# docs_flutter

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter Basic application.

I create this repo for developers who are learning flutter from the basic. The source that I got was from the flutter docs and others source. If you want to contribute, please request this repo.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
